#ImageProcessor

ImageProcessor is a Python class that creates a GUI application for basic image processing operations. It uses the OpenCV and Tkinter libraries to display and manipulate image files.
#Features

    Open and display image files in various formats, including JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
    Reset the image to its original state.
    Convert the image to grayscale.
    Invert the image colors.
    Resize the image to a specified width and height.
    Rotate the image by a specified angle.
    Save the modified image to a file in various formats, including JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

#Getting Started

    To use ImageProcessor, you'll need to have Python 3 and the OpenCV and Tkinter libraries installed on your computer. You can install these libraries using       the following commands:

    pip install opencv-python
    pip install tkinter

    Once you have the required libraries installed, you can import the ImageProcessor class into your Python script and create an instance of the class to start     using it.


#Usage

    Once you have created an instance of the ImageProcessor class, you can use the GUI to open and manipulate image files. The GUI has buttons and entry boxes       for each of the image processing operations, making it easy to perform basic image processing tasks.
